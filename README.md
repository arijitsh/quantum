# Qunatum Information and Quantum Cryptography Assignments

Author : Arijit Shaw.

Instructor : Arpita Maitra

## Assignment 2 : Quantum Key Distribution

Codes are available at the following files:

BB84 : `a2-bb84.py` 

Ekert :`a2-ekert.py`

SQKD : `a2-sqkd.py`

Results of running those are shown in `assignment-2-qkd` jupyter notebook.

Set `verb = True` in the codes to see the interim results and quantum circuits generated.

### CNOT Attacks on the protocols

Run `a2-bb84.py 1`, `a2-ekert.py 1` or `a2-sqkd.py 1` to perform CNOT attack in the protocols. 

Results are also shown in the jupyter notebook.

## Assignment 1 : Superdense Coding and Teleportation

Experiments with Qiskit codes are done in Jupyter notebooks.
